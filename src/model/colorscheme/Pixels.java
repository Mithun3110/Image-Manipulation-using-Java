/**
 * Interface representing a pixel or a set of pixels in an image. This interface can be implemented
 * by classes that represent different types of pixel data structures or color schemes.
 *
 * <p>Implementations of this interface would typically define how pixel data
 * is stored and manipulated (e.g., RGB, grayscale, etc.), and may provide methods for operations
 * such as getting or setting pixel values, applying color transformations, etc.
 *
 * <p>This interface serves as a common type for various pixel representations,
 * allowing different image processing methods to work with any pixel format.
