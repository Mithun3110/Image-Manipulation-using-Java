## Change log

### Changed AbstractPixel (Abstract Class) to Pixels (Interface)
- The RGBPixel class, previously extending an abstract class, was refactored to implement an interface, as inheritance was unnecessary.
- All instances of the 2D array representations were updated to use the interface instead of directly referencing RGBPixel.

### I/O Operations was moved from model to controller
- The I/O operations for loading and saving images were initially handled within the model.
- These operations were refactored and moved to the controller, ensuring that the controller can manage image loading and saving independently, without needing to directly access the model.

### Top level interface created for the model and controller
- The Image.java class, which was originally the top-level class of the model, did not implement any interface. To address this, a new interface called ImageModel was created, and the Image.java class was updated to implement it.
- Similarly, a new interface named ImageControllerInterface was introduced for the controller, and the ImageController class was modified to implement this interface.

### All operations except the main was moved from View to the Controller
- The ScriptReader.java class was relocated from the view to the controller, as input parsing should be handled by the controller, not the view.
- The ImageView.java class was removed, and its functionality was integrated into the ImageController.java class within the controller, centralizing all related operations.
